                    <meta name="description" content="Celebrities are perhaps the most talked about, but the most misunderstood element of modern society. The media focus on celebrities has significantly increased in the past few decades. Every day we are bombarded with images that celebrate the lives of the rich and famous. Many will say, with great agitation, that celebrity culture has developed into a virus that infects our society. The desire for fame and wealth is just a symptom of a more superficial society where personal glory has became one of the most important life goals. Even though we must not ignore that we live in a world where the last exploits of the Kardashian family are preferred over other news stories. Through the negativity that is mostly around celebrity culture we forget to see the important underlying messages and social demands in our modern society.
Since Hollywood became a dream factory people have been projecting their own fantasies of fame and wealth on celebrities. The functions  of celebrity culture seems to contain important parallels with the functions and appearances that were normally ascribed to religion. The ‘known unknown’ is a familiar concept in the history of humanity. People have always looked up to individuals who were not physically near us. If you look at religion from the basis it are mostly stories about people who have learned several lessons in life. Due to a more secularized society, boundaries are blurring between religion and celebrity culture. As seen in Greek mythology and the tales of saints, we can see the same kind of mythical figures and moral stories raising from celebrity culture. The only thing that seems changed is the magnitude of the current stories, the large range and the huge number of characters that enter our modern world.
This thesis will explore the religious signs in celebrity culture to show that this culture is perhaps not as meaningless as many people would say. From classic examples as Micheal Jacksons performance of the song ‘Earth’ at the United Kingdom’s Brit Awards or the ‘queen of pop’ Madonna hanging on a cross during her Confessions Tour, to contemporary examples as Kanye West. He calls himself “Yeezus” and recently had a son who he called ‘Saint’. We will determine the psychological power behind fans that drives “Believers” and “Directioners” to extreme idolatry as well as the reason why people have negative relations with certain celebrities.
Some celebrities have achieved a status that goes beyond the human status and in the end we may have to conclude that celebrities have become a new source of myths and mythical icons in our modern society. And remember, there is a belieber in all of us …" />
